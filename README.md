The code for trial was first tested locally and made proper adjustments before launching it on hugging face through chainlit using dockerfile after going through multiple trials and errors. You can find it in the first link above
The final code was modified for an engineering trainer that can answer from multiple engineering domains and guardrails were put in place to block any other inputs that are not related to those domains.
